# AWE_PINN
This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for solving the Acoustic Wave Equation (AWE). The notebook includes data preparation, model setup, training process, and solution visualization. It is part of a research project to understand and simulate wave propagation using machine learning techniques.
